# Node-RED nodes for ctrlX AUTOMATION

This package **node-red-contrib-ctrlx-automation** contains nodes to easily connect to [ctrlX AUTOMATION](https://www.ctrlx-automation.com/) devices from [Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com).

Using the nodes you can read from and write to the ctrlX Data Layer.  
The nodes can run in a Node-RED app environment on a ctrlX CORE device as well as on a third-party device which runs Node-RED.

**Important:** Please upgrade the AutomationCore System App to at least version 1.8.0 (XCR-V-0108, part of ReleaseMilestone 21.03) or newer, because the nodes are now using the new API which introduces subscription support!

## Installation

Install using the managed palette from inside Node-RED.

### In Node-RED (preferred)

* Via **Manage Palette** -> **Search** for `node-red-contrib-ctrlx-automation`

### In a shell

* go to the Node-RED user data directory, e.g.: `~/.node-red`
* run `npm install node-red-contrib-ctrlx-automation --save`

## Usage - Quick Overview

There are two new nodes which appear in the category **ctrlX AUTOMATION** in your Node-RED palette.
In addition to that, a configuration node will be added to the project as soon as the nodes are used in a flow. The configuration node contains all settings for a connection to a device and is used by other nodes which are embedded in the flow and share the same session. Besides the hostname or IP address it is also necessary to provide the user credentials for authorization of your session in the configuration node.

### Data Layer Request

This node can be triggered to execute read, write, browse, create or delete operations within the ctrlX Data Layer.

### Data Layer Subscribe

This node allows to subscribe to value changes of an item in the ctrlX Data Layer. It is an input node, which does not need to be triggered, but automatically emits a new `msg`, when the value changes. The node is useful for continuous tracking of value in the ctrlX Data Layer and in this case more efficient than the `Data Layer Request` node, because it does not need to be triggerd to poll for a value. Instead, this node automatically watches for value changes on server side and publishes new values via server sent events and low overhead for data transmission.

## Usage - Reference Manual

Besides this quick introduction, there is a [Reference Manual](./doc/REFERENCE.md) which describes the nodes in more detail. It covers all the different configuration options, error handling, troubleshouting and generals hints for usage.
For working with different nodes in the Data Layer it might also be useful to have a look at the [Data Type Overview](./doc/DATATYPES.md).

## Examples

It might be helpful to have a look at the [Examples](./doc/EXAMPLES.md) document to find various flows for different use-cases. They demonstrate the different ways how the nodes can be used. Most of the examples are also directly available from within the Node-RED editor.
They appear under the Examples section of the library import menu in Node-RED.
